Several techniques can be employed to mitigate mode collapse in generative models, especially in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
Here are some effective methods: Adding Noise During Training: 

1.Injecting noise into the training process can help the generator explore different parts of the data distribution. Common techniques include adding Gaussian noise to input data or latent space or applying dropout during training.

### Stability Improvement:

- Injecting instance noise into the discriminator input means adding noise to the data samples that the discriminator receives.
- This noise disrupts the discriminator's ability to precisely distinguish between real and generated samples.
- As a result, the discriminator becomes less sensitive to small variations in the input data, making it harder for it to dominate the training process.
- By making the discriminator's task more difficult, instance noise encourages the generator to produce more diverse and realistic samples.
